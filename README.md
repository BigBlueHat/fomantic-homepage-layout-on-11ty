# Fomantic's Homepage Layout as an 11ty site.

Fomantic (a community fork of Semantic-UI) provides a number of handy starter
layouts. I have often used some or all of the "Homepage" layout when setting up
sites...and often those sites were powered by 11ty. This is an attempt to make
my life (and yours!) just a bit simpler by providing a template repo to jump
start the process.

## Usage

```sh
npm i
npm run build # to just output the static files into `_site/`
npm run serve # to host a hot-reloading preview at http://localhost:8080/
```
